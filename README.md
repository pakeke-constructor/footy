# FOOTY GAME:


## branch names:
Lets prefix branch-names with trello ticket id  
EG:   
`trello-ticket id=34  "Create the player animation"`  

The branch could be:  `34/create-player-animation`

If you dont have a trello ticket to use, just create one, and assign yourself to it.  
This ensures that we are all on the same page.  




## Objective:
Get an MVP out ASAP.  
Pitch to publishers, secure a steam page and launch strategy.
