# GOOFY AH FOOTY (name TBD)

A 3d multiplayer party game.

Pretty much soccer, (2 goals, 2 teams, 1 ball) 
but with many added "party" elements; like powerups, random events, added chaos.


The game is meant for fun, not competitive or serious at all.  
Just hop on with your friends and play a game or two.

Random stuff can happen during the game to add to the "party" nature of it-
- random physics-objects can spawn
- players can change teams
- players can get hold of weapons/tools to add chaos
- stuff can interfere with the game

Hopefully you get the idea.

Similar games in terms of soccer aspect:

- Rocket league, REMATCH?


Ideal publisher:
- Landfall games (specializes in physics-based party games)


# ESSENTIALS:
- Must FEEL good. Clientside prediction, snappy game-feel, non-janky controls
- Excellent collision physics required
- Needs good "theming" and "identity". More on this below.

----------


## Player control / physics:
Inspired by soccer-physics. 
Silly to control character, (Eg kick = jump?)
Teammates can kick their own team-mates, sending them flying
Can punch other players, and pick up and throw objects
Players should be able to kick other physics objects just like the ball
Players should have googly-eyes

## Theming / Aesthetic:
- Characters with googly eyes
- A goofy crowd that cheers when yous core
- a game-atmosphere that makes you feel like a football star
- "Streakers" that run across the pitch


## Teams:
2 teams; team-A and team-B. 2v2, 3v3, etc.  

If there's an odd-number of players, one player becomes the referee.
The referee's goal is to make the game a draw.  

Players can choose their team-name at the start of the game...? (Giant keyboard...?)


## Pitch:
The pitch itself should be small-ish, to encourage fast-paced gameplay.  
Should it be like an ice-hockey pitch? with room behind the goals?  
How big should the goals be?  


## Ball-physics:
Over-tuned bouncy-ness, 
Cartoonishly large size,
Bounces off players very "randomly", (low restitution)
Trail that follows the ball


## Balancing:
Party-games should be self-balancing.
Add a lot of randomness
Make weapons/tools decay after a few uses.
Physics objects also shouldn't last forever, or else players can fill their goals up with them

# RANDOM IDEAS:

## Physics Objects:
To add to the playful nature, random physics-objects spawn which players can interact with.  
=---------  
fridges, giant blocks, elephants
giant burgers,
giant hotdogs,
cheeses, couches, etc.
landmines that blow stuff away


## Environment Objects:
Ideas for "big" things that can appear:

Giant wrecking-balls swinging above the map, bouncing stuff away  
Giant chicken that waddles around the pitch randomly 


## Tools / Weapons 
Players can also pick up weapons/tools:
Trumpets that make toot sounds, and blast stuff away
Blocky gun, that shoots out giant physics blocks
Throwable banana that makes a huge explosion
Baseball bat, makes a [bonk sound](https://youtu.be/ZXK427oXjn8?feature=shared) and stops the object's movement (including players)
Banana-peel, causes players to slip up and flip in a comical way [sound fx](https://youtu.be/kKPAt6DoLyA?feature=shared)
Candy cane, when a player is bonked with the candy cane, the two players swap teams.
