## GAME DESIGN: Core tenets-
- Party game
- Fun with friends



Can we somehow structure the game such that it's naturally party-like?

## PARTY-IDEA:
FFA-style football!

Every player gets a score.
Every round, teams are shuffled, 3v3 football.

When a team scores, all players on that team gets a point.
Then, the teams are shuffled again.



## DIFFERENTIATION IDEA:
We also should look at differentiating it a bit from football.
--->  
- What if the goals were elevated off the ground...?
- Ramps where the goals are?
